# nonparam: A Non-Parametric R Package

### Functions

This package includes functions that replicate the most common non-parametric statistical tests: Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman. 

Each function within this package accepts two vectors of data that are to be compared, and returns the appropriate information. Some of the functions return more information than others, and the exact information they require and output are in their respective help pages. It can also be seen in the Overview vignette.
