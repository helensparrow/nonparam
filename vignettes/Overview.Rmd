Included is the data which compares high school graduation rates and the amount of money spent on secondary education across the United States.


### wilcoxontest
Example:
```{r}
(w1 <- wilcoxon(c(1,2,3), c(6,5,4)))
w21 <- rnorm(15, 0, 1); w22 <- rnorm(15, 5, 1)
(w2 <- wilcoxon(w21, w22))
```



Comparison:
```{r}
# built-in
wilcox.test(c(1,2,3), c(6,5,4))
wilcox.test(w21, w22)
```



### kendalltest
Example:
```{r}
kendall(data)
```



Comparison:
```{r}
# built-in
cor.test(x = data$dpp, y = data$pct, method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "greater")
```


### spearmantest
Example:
```{r}
library(SuppDists)
spearman(c(1,2,3), c(6,5,4))
spearman(w21, w22)
```



Comparison:
```{r}
# built-in
cor.test(c(1,2,3), c(6,5,4), method = "spearman", alternative = "greater")
cor.test(x = w21, y = w22, method = "spearman", alternative = "greater")
```
